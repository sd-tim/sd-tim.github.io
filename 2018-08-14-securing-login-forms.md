This is an idea which has been rumbling around in my mind for a while. With more site becoming "Single Page Apps" and the majority of the code running in the browser, with the rest being API endpoints on the server, how can we make the login form more secure without putting all the details in the browser?

## Overkill, purely academic

This is mostly just me thinking out-loud, but I welcome any and all input.
